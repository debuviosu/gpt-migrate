# L'Arabe Langue Vivante: A Classic Book for Learning Arabic
  
If you are looking for a book to learn Arabic, you may have heard of **L'Arabe Langue Vivante**, a two-volume book by H. Atoui, a professor of Arabic. This book was published in 1978 and has been used for more than 30 years to teach Arabic in francophone Africa, especially in Niger[^1^] [^2^]. Many Arabic teachers consider this book to be one of the best, if not the best, available in this field[^1^] [^2^]. But what makes this book so special and effective? And how can you get a copy of it?
  
## What is L'Arabe Langue Vivante?
  
**L'Arabe Langue Vivante** (which means "Arabic: A Living Language") is a book that aims to teach Arabic as a spoken and written language, not as a classical or religious one. It uses a progressive and communicative approach, introducing new vocabulary, grammar, and cultural aspects through dialogues, exercises, and texts. The book covers both the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and the colloquial Arabic of North Africa (Maghrebi). It also includes audio recordings of native speakers to help with pronunciation and listening comprehension.

The book is divided into two volumes: the first one covers the basics of Arabic, such as the alphabet, the sounds, the nouns, the verbs, the pronouns, the numbers, the greetings, etc. The second one goes deeper into more complex topics, such as the verb tenses, the moods, the cases, the adjectives, the adverbs, the prepositions, etc. Each volume has 15 lessons, each with a main dialogue, a grammar explanation, a vocabulary list, some exercises, and some supplementary texts. The book also has some appendices with useful information, such as verb conjugation tables, irregular verbs, common expressions, etc.
  
## Why is L'Arabe Langue Vivante Effective?
  
One of the main reasons why **L'Arabe Langue Vivante** is effective is that it teaches Arabic in a natural and contextual way. It does not rely on memorization or translation, but on understanding and using the language in real situations. The book exposes learners to different varieties of Arabic, both formal and informal, and shows how they are used in different contexts. The book also incorporates cultural elements that enrich the learning experience and help learners appreciate the diversity and richness of the Arab world.
  
Another reason why **L'Arabe Langue Vivante** is effective is that it is comprehensive and thorough. It covers all the essential aspects of Arabic grammar and syntax, as well as a wide range of vocabulary from different fields and domains. The book also provides plenty of practice opportunities for learners to reinforce what they have learned and to develop their skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening. The book is designed to take learners from a beginner level to an intermediate level of proficiency in Arabic.
